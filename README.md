# A recommendation
You were linked here most likely by an is-a.dev staff member.

This is because you don't know how to read [documentation](https://www.is-a.dev/docs). That's okay, we have a better solution for you.

## Solution
1. Go to https://github.com/open-domains/register#register
2. Follow the instructions to register <yourname>.is-not-a.dev (very difficult, with a high learning curve)
3. Enjoy your domain which matches you!
